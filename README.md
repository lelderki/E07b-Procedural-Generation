# E07b-Procedural-Generation

Excersize for MSCH-C 220 Indiana University 2020

Seeing how TileMap nodes work and to see how procedural generation might work in a project.

This exercise is taken from the [Procedural Content Generation in Godot Part 1: Mazes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YShYWaGF3Nc) from KidsCanCode. The video will guide you through the steps required to procedurally generate a maze from a TileMap. If it is useful, the same tutorial has also been [written out](http://kidscancode.org/blog/2018/08/godot3_procgen1/).

The algorithm is relatively simple (and I will try to explain more about it in class); the hardest part is figuring out how to represent the possible choices that the algorithm will be making. Try not to get too concerned during the discussion about binary values and bitwise operations; just be aware that there are some nice properties inherent to how binary values work that makes this approach possible.

After you have completed the exercise, run the program. Update the LICENSE and README.md, and then turn in the URL to your repository on Canvas.
